<H1>1. MII Interface (mii_interface)</H1>
<H2>1.1. MII Interface - Overview</H2>
<P>
This component is loosely based on the IEEE Draft P802.3u MII Management Interface standard.
</P>
<H2>1.2. Frame Format</H2>
<P>
At the rising edge of <B>rst</B>, the MII standard device loads the device address into the REGISTER ADDRESS and uses it to
decode accesses to its registers. After a power-on reset, the MII specification defines a set of thirty-two 16-bit status and control 
registers. The frame is formatted as follows (in bit order across MDIO)

The figure bellow shows the driver configuration implemented in this programmable logic description. Note that data output turn to 
tri-state mode when the module is in read mode. This action is executed by the logic being it not crontroled by user.

<H2>1.3. Management Frame Format Description</H2>
<P>
<B>Start of frame</B>: Start of frame is indicated by <B>01</B> pattern.
</P>
<P>
<B>Operation code</B>: The operation code field indicates the type of transaction being performed by the frame. A <B>01</B> pattern indicates 
that the frame payload contains data to be written to the register. A <B>10</B> pattern indicates that the frame payload will contain data 
to be read from the register.
</P>
<P>
<B>Device Address</B>: The device compares the address bits of the device address field to the latched address bits. If they are equal, 
the device proceeds with the access. If they are not equal, the device ignores the access and does not drive the <B>mdio</B> signal.
</P>
<P>
<B>Register address</B>: This field is used to select the registers to be accessed. The register address 8 bits.
</P>
<P>
<B>Turnaround</B>: This field between register address field and data field is used to avoid contention on <B>mdio</B>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Data field</B>: This field has 16 bits (MII standard) width but its contents is configurable by generics. When a smaller data width is 
chosen, the MSBs is driven to '0' and the written word is placed in the LSBs. The first bit transmitted is bit 15. Data bits are 
latched in or out of the MII device on the rising edge of <B>mdc* for write operation and falling edge of **mdc</B> for read operation.
</P>
<P>
<B>Idle condition</B>: A final clock puts <B>mdio</B> back in an idle state (<B>mdio</B> is tri-stated and pulled-up). Thus in the idle state 
all the drivers are disabled and the MII bus is in the high impedance state. The MII device bus requires idle state for 1 clock period.
</P>
<P>
<I><B>NOTE:</B> Some devices needs more the one <B>mdc</B> clock periods in idle state, in contrast to the IEEE Draft P802.3u that requires</I>
<I>idle state for one clock periods.</I>
</P>
<H3>1.3.1. Turnaround</H3>
<P>
The figure bellow shows the functional timing for the turn around (TA) portion of a read access. The arrows on the clock edges indicate 
which edge is used by the MII device for each event. The MII device clocks data in on <B>mdc's</B> rising edge and clocks data out on 
<B>mdc's</B> falling edge.
</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="figures/mii_read_action.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Step 1</B>: A '1' is being clocked in on the rising edge of <B>mdc</B> as the last bit of the register address field;
<P></P>
<LI><B>Step 2</B>: A ‘Z’ is being clocked into the MII device on the rising edge of <B>mdc</B>. This is the first part of the turn around which 
gives time for the driver to turn off and to allow data to be driven by the MII device. On the falling edge of the same clock period, 
the MII device drives a '0' on to <B>mdio</B> as the second part of the turn around;
<P></P>
<LI><B>Step 3</B>: A '0' is being clocked out from the MII device on the falling edge. This is the first '0' of the 16-bit data field.
</UL>

<P>
<I><B>IMPORTANT:</B> For a read transaction, the <B>mdio</B> should be in a tri-state for the first part of the turn around. The device drives</I>
<I>a zero during the second part of the turn around. The figure bellow shows which clock edges are being used for the turn around during</I>
<I>the read operation.</I>
</P>
<P>
For a write transaction, the system will drive a '1' for the first bit time, and a '0' for the second bit time of the turn around. 
Look at figure bellow for which clock edges are being used for the turn around during the write operation.

The figure above shows the functional timing for the turn around (TA) portion of a write access. The arrows on the clock edges indicate 
which edge is used by the MII device for each event. The data is clocked in the MII device on the <B>mdc's</B> rising edge.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Step A - A '1' is being clocked in on the rising edge of <B>mdc</B> as the last bit of the register address field;
<LI>Step B - A '1' is being clocked into the <B>mdio</B> on the rising edge of <B>mdc</B>. This is the first part of the turn around;
<LI>Step C - A '0' is being clocked into the MII device on the rising edge of <B>mdc</B> as the second part of the turn around.

<H2>1.7. Operation's Communication</H2>
<P>
Here is presented two simple example of write and read communication with MII interface module.
</P>
<H3>1.7.1. Write Comunication</H3>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="figures/mii_wr_frm.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
In the picture above is presented a write communication whit MII interface module. Note that the first two bits is a start frame 
indication, after came anothers two bits that indicates the read/write operation, in this case a write operation. The next field in 
MII frame is the device address followed by register address. Then thera a two bits that indicates turn-around (for this example these 
bits are "10"). The data came in the next useful field and the last field is a ilustration of the idle MII bus condition.
</P>
<H3>1.7.2. Read Comunication</H3>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="figures/mii_rd_frm.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
The picture above shows a read communication whit MII interface module. Note that the first two bits (start frame) is equal the first 
two bits of write communication frame. The read/write operation field has a read pattern, and the device and register addresses is the 
same as showed in write frame comunication, but the turn-around field has a read turn-around patters ("1Z"). The following fields are 
equal as the write frame communication, the difference is in the clock edge that register data, that inverts in read turn-around.
